. figure out how to get lex to accept strings with \" in them
. strings are not fully displayable, (ie. "a\nb" displays as a\nb where \n is
    not a newline)

. printf (print + format)
. implement format
. implement let values
. have better printing of struct schema when bad vals are used to construct a struct
. regex
. hash maps

. load
    - allow a list of args
    - private (not shared) variables starting in _ (ie _f, private var f)
    - prefix in
