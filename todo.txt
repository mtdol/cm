. standardized testing
. how exactly should type system work

. implement: format, splice, match, fun (if static type system), fun?
. implement def, let, values, lam
. when keyword for match statement and in general
    - a when b else c
    - match arg with [a, b when c;], [c,b;];
        - two different forms like this?
. look into error handeling system

. self recurse keyword?
. struct dataatype
. def values x,y,z = ...
. load
    - loads both racket modules and cm ones
