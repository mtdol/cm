- line number re-reform:
    -- change trace to show only function names

- `schemaof`
    -- returns the schema as a list of strings

- ability to index structs by schema elem names
    >> typedef S := a,b;.
    >> def s := struct S (1,3;).
    >> -- yields 1
    >> s::"a"

- `...` match-expr operator
  -- yields ((2, 3;), 1, 4)
  match {list 1|2|3|4}
  | a, b, ..., c; -> b, a, c
  end
